Mailing lists
=============

The REST API can be queried for the set of known mailing lists.  There is a
top level collection that can return all the mailing lists.  There aren't any
yet though.

    >>> dump_json('http://localhost:9001/3.0/lists')
    http_etag: "..."
    start: 0
    total_size: 0

Create a mailing list in a domain and it's accessible via the API.
::

    >>> mlist = create_list('ant@example.com')
    >>> transaction.commit()

    >>> dump_json('http://localhost:9001/3.0/lists')
    entry 0:
        display_name: Ant
        fqdn_listname: ant@example.com
        http_etag: "..."
        list_id: ant.example.com
        list_name: ant
        mail_host: example.com
        member_count: 0
        self_link: http://localhost:9001/3.0/lists/ant.example.com
        volume: 1
    http_etag: "..."
    start: 0
    total_size: 1

You can also query for lists from a particular domain.

    >>> dump_json('http://localhost:9001/3.0/domains/example.com/lists')
    entry 0:
        display_name: Ant
        fqdn_listname: ant@example.com
        http_etag: "..."
        list_id: ant.example.com
        list_name: ant
        mail_host: example.com
        member_count: 0
        self_link: http://localhost:9001/3.0/lists/ant.example.com
        volume: 1
    http_etag: "..."
    start: 0
    total_size: 1


Creating lists via the API
==========================

New mailing lists can also be created through the API, by posting to the
``lists`` URL.

    >>> dump_json('http://localhost:9001/3.0/lists', {
    ...           'fqdn_listname': 'bee@example.com',
    ...           })
    content-length: 0
    date: ...
    location: http://localhost:9001/3.0/lists/bee.example.com
    ...

The mailing list exists in the database.
::

    >>> from mailman.interfaces.listmanager import IListManager
    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> list_manager = getUtility(IListManager)

    >>> bee = list_manager.get('bee@example.com')
    >>> bee
    <mailing list "bee@example.com" at ...>

The mailing list was created using the default style, which allows list posts.

    >>> bee.allow_list_posts
    True

.. Abort the Storm transaction.
    >>> transaction.abort()

It is also available in the REST API via the location given in the response.

    >>> dump_json('http://localhost:9001/3.0/lists/bee.example.com')
    display_name: Bee
    fqdn_listname: bee@example.com
    http_etag: "..."
    list_id: bee.example.com
    list_name: bee
    mail_host: example.com
    member_count: 0
    self_link: http://localhost:9001/3.0/lists/bee.example.com
    volume: 1

Normally, you access the list via its RFC 2369 list-id as shown above, but for
backward compatibility purposes, you can also access it via the list's posting
address, if that has never been changed (since the list-id is immutable, but
the posting address is not).

    >>> dump_json('http://localhost:9001/3.0/lists/bee@example.com')
    display_name: Bee
    fqdn_listname: bee@example.com
    http_etag: "..."
    list_id: bee.example.com
    list_name: bee
    mail_host: example.com
    member_count: 0
    self_link: http://localhost:9001/3.0/lists/bee.example.com
    volume: 1


Apply a style at list creation time
-----------------------------------

:ref:`List styles <list-styles>` allow you to more easily create mailing lists
of a particular type, e.g. discussion lists.  We can see which styles are
available, and which is the default style.

    >>> dump_json('http://localhost:9001/3.0/lists/styles')
    default: legacy-default
    http_etag: "..."
    style_names: ['legacy-announce', 'legacy-default']

When creating a list, if we don't specify a style to apply, the default style
is used.  However, we can provide a style name in the POST data to choose a
different style.

    >>> dump_json('http://localhost:9001/3.0/lists', {
    ...           'fqdn_listname': 'cat@example.com',
    ...           'style_name': 'legacy-announce',
    ...           })
    content-length: 0
    date: ...
    location: http://localhost:9001/3.0/lists/cat.example.com
    ...

We can tell that the list was created using the `legacy-announce` style,
because announce lists don't allow posting by the general public.

    >>> cat = list_manager.get('cat@example.com')
    >>> cat.allow_list_posts
    False

.. Abort the Storm transaction.
    >>> transaction.abort()


Deleting lists via the API
==========================

Existing mailing lists can be deleted through the API, by doing an HTTP
``DELETE`` on the mailing list URL.
::

    >>> dump_json('http://localhost:9001/3.0/lists/bee.example.com',
    ...           method='DELETE')
    content-length: 0
    date: ...
    server: ...
    status: 204

The mailing list does not exist.

    >>> print list_manager.get('bee@example.com')
    None

.. Abort the Storm transaction.
    >>> transaction.abort()

For backward compatibility purposes, you can delete a list via its posting
address as well.

    >>> dump_json('http://localhost:9001/3.0/lists/ant@example.com',
    ...           method='DELETE')
    content-length: 0
    date: ...
    server: ...
    status: 204

The mailing list does not exist.

    >>> print list_manager.get('ant@example.com')
    None
